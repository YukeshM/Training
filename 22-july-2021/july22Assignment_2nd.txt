

	Rather than reading articles before I watch videos on youtube for basic.
	Then with the basic I wil start surf more about the topics.
	visit the website for more and clear explanation.

	All the questions are come under delegates. 

	function method in c sharp:
	youtube link: https://youtu.be/4trl43Ycksg
	I mostly read the topics from tutorial point and tutorial teacher website.

	Anonymous methods in C sharp can be defined using the delegate keyword and can
	be assigned to a variable of delegate type.
 

	func in c sharp:

	Func is a generic delegate included in the System namespace.
	It has zero or more input parameters and one out parameter.
	The last parameter is considered as an out parameter.

	action in c sharp:

	Action is a delegate type defined in the System namespace. 
	An Action type delegate is the same as Func delegate except that the Action delegate doesn't return a value. 
	In other words, an Action delegate can be used with a method that has a void return type.

	predicate in c sharp:

	Predicate is the delegate like Func and Action delegates. 
	It represents a method containing a set of criteria and checks whether the passed parameter meets those criteria.
	A predicate delegate methods must take one input parameter and return a boolean - true or false.

	delegates in c sharp:

	A delegate is an object which refers to a method or you can say it is a reference type variable that can hold a reference to the methods. 
	Delegates in C# are similar to the function pointer in C/C++. 
	It provides a way which tells which method is to be called when an event is triggered.
